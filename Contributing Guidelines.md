# Contributing Guidelines
We're really excited that you're interested to contribute to the Audio Filter Library. We appreciate any help you can provide, and we want the process to be as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## Reporting a bug
Discussing the current state of the code
Submitting a fix
Proposing new features
Becoming a maintainer
We Develop with Github
We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use Github Flow
All code changes happen through pull requests. Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use Github Flow). We actively welcome your pull requests:

Fork the repo and create your branch from main.
If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
Ensure the test suite passes.
Make sure your code lints.
Issue that pull request!
## Any Contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same MIT License that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue, it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
Great Bug Reports tend to have:

A quick summary and/or background
Steps to reproduce
Be specific!
Give sample code if you can.
What you expected would happen
What actually happens
Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
People love thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
Ensure your code adheres to the coding style used throughout the project. Consistency helps readability and makes it easier for everyone to understand the code.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT License.
